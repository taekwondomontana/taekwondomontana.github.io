        <p>
          Modern Taekwondo represents 2000 years of evolution in Korean martial art. As an art of self-defense it is unequaled in the power and effectiveness of its technique.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          <strong>Kim’s Taekwondo School</strong> is the largest martial art school in the northwest United States. With over 50 full-time schools and part-time training centers, we have the responsibility of training approximately 2000 active students.
        </p>
        <p>Students learn self-defense, self-confidence, self-discipline and receive an aerobic workout through traditional non-contact lessons. Classes are open to men, women and children ages 7 and up. Pee-Wee classes are available for 5-7 years old.</p>
        <p>We practice traditional, non-contact Taekwondo.  This allows students of all ages and abilities to work out together.  This also makes us a family friendly school where family members can attend the same classes.</p>
